this is the greatest sandwich i have
ever had in my life
the tomato are exquisite
they come from oaxaca mexico
oaxacan tomato are some of the best in the world
this happened because in 1892
a great flood wiped out all of the pepper in oaxaca
pepper were the staple crop and they were
Grade a pepper
the tomato had never recieved a Grade
howeverr, they grew the tomato on a hil
so while the Grade a pepper were flooded
the tomato continued to grow
the people of oaxaca stopped growing pepper
they requested a Grade for their tomato
they were special Grade
oaxaca became known for their tomato
though the pepper is still remembered
this concludes my fictional historically relevant poem
which i will turn in for a Grade
