Question 2: [10 points]
Use grep to find all of the lines in some files that contain the string tomato. Your
output will display the line numbers of the matching lines. For this one, use one or
more filenames in place of the word some. Just read the manpage, this is simple. tomato
In this, some does not always mean use wildcards. I could just list four files on the
command line. But I expect to see a line that shows that you tried it with more than
one file at a time. tomato
tomato

Question 3: [10 points]
Use grep and wc to count the number of lines in some files that do NOT contain the
word pepper. You should not use grep’s “-c” option because I want a single line
of output from the command with a total line count regardless of the number of files
processed at one time. pepper  Note: This will require a pipe. It will very definitely NOT
require any temporary files or pepper any utilities other that the two specified.
Some files is the same as the previous problem.

Question 4: [10 points]
Use find Gade and grep to print the lines in the all the “.txt” files (like in the first problem)
that have the string Grade in them. The output should include the name of the
matching file(s) as well as the that actual matching line(s) of text. Do not number the
lines. READ the man page on find. This will require the use of find’s “-exec” and
“-name” options. Grade This WILL NOT require any pipes or any other utilities besides find
and grep. Be careful to protect all wildcards in filenames with single quotes. If you do
NOT use find to locate the files, the answer is just wrong. Grade
